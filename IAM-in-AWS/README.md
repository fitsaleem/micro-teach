# what is IAM in AWS ?

*IAM stands for Identity and Access Management and it is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to manage users and their access to AWS resources. IAM enables you to create and manage user accounts, groups, and permissions, allowing you to control who can access your AWS resources and what actions they can perform on those resources.*

*With IAM, you can create multiple users with unique credentials and permissions, and you can also create groups to organize your users and set permissions for them collectively. IAM enables you to assign policies to users and groups to grant or deny access to specific AWS resources, as well as to monitor and audit user activity to maintain security and compliance.*

*IAM is a critical component of AWS security and is essential for organizations that need to manage access to their AWS resources securely and efficiently.*
