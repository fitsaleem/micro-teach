# what is IAM in AWS ?

*IAM stands for Identity and Access Management and it is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to manage users and their access to AWS resources. IAM enables you to create and manage user accounts, groups, and permissions, allowing you to control who can access your AWS resources and what actions they can perform on those resources.
