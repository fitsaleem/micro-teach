***why we need multi cloud***

infrastructure as a service(Iaas) build,run

platform as a service(paas)run

software as a service(saas)

the resource providers are :

1: azure

2: aws

3: gcp

***what is enterprise access***

. IAM(identity access managment)

. IDP(identity data provider)

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM) are security practices that are commonly used in organizations to protect sensitive data and systems.

PIM refers to the process of managing and securing privileged accounts, which are accounts with elevated permissions that provide access to sensitive resources within an organization. PIM tools are used to monitor and manage privileged accounts, including the creation, deletion, and modification of these accounts.

PAM, on the other hand, is the practice of controlling and monitoring access to privileged accounts and resources within an organization. This includes implementing security policies, restricting access to sensitive resources, and monitoring privileged user activity.

Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) are specialized workstations used by privileged users to perform sensitive tasks that require elevated access. These workstations are designed to be highly secure and are used to prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive information or systems.

Cloud-based PIM and PAM solutions are becoming increasingly popular, as more organizations move their IT infrastructure to the cloud. These solutions provide a centralized management interface for managing privileged accounts and access to sensitive resources across cloud-based environments.

**Here's a practical life example that illustrates the importance of PIM and PAM**

Let's say you work for a large financial institution that handles sensitive financial information and transactions for millions of customers. In this scenario, PIM and PAM would be critical to maintaining the security and integrity of the institution's systems and data.

For example, PIM would be used to manage privileged accounts such as those used by IT administrators, executives, and other high-level employees. This would involve creating separate accounts for each employee, monitoring their activity, and revoking access when necessary.

PAM would be used to control and monitor access to sensitive systems and data within the organization. This would involve implementing access controls, restricting access to certain areas of the network, and monitoring user activity to detect any unauthorized access.

In addition, PAWs would be used by privileged users to perform sensitive tasks, such as transferring large sums of money or making changes to the organization's systems. These workstations would be highly secure and would only be used for privileged activities, ensuring that any malicious actors would be unable to gain access to sensitive information or systems.

By implementing PIM and PAM practices, the financial institution would be able to maintain the security and integrity of its systems and data, protecting its customers and ensuring that the institution remains in compliance with regulations and industry standards.
