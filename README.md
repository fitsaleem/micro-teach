Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM) are security practices that are commonly used in organizations to protect sensitive data and systems.

PIM refers to the process of managing and securing privileged accounts, which are accounts with elevated permissions that provide access to sensitive resources within an organization. PIM tools are used to monitor and manage privileged accounts, including the creation, deletion, and modification of these accounts.

PAM, on the other hand, is the practice of controlling and monitoring access to privileged accounts and resources within an organization. This includes implementing security policies, restricting access to sensitive resources, and monitoring privileged user activity.

Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) are specialized workstations used by privileged users to perform sensitive tasks that require elevated access. These workstations are designed to be highly secure and are used to prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive information or systems.

Cloud-based PIM and PAM solutions are becoming increasingly popular, as more organizations move their IT infrastructure to the cloud. These solutions provide a centralized management interface for managing privileged accounts and access to sensitive resources across cloud-based environments.
